# Discount Effect on Customer Retention & Profitability

**Description**

This was a group final project in a Research Design class. Our group chose to analyze the effect of discounts and coupons on customer retention and profitability by hypothetically partnering with Joe's Pizza. While the research was not actually conducted, it was thoroughly designed so that it would be ready for implementation.
