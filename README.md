# Discount Effect on Customer Retention & Profitability

**Description**

This was a group research design project. Our group chose to design a reserach that would analyze the effects of discounts and coupons on customer retention and profitability in a restaurant by hypothetically partnering with Joe's Pizza. While the research was not actually conducted, it was thoroughly designed so that it would be ready for implementation.
